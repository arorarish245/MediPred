# MediPred
Created an innovative multi-disease prediction system that combines machine learning and web development. By analyzing data from five disease-specific datasets, the predictive model detects diseases early. Using Flask, user-friendly web interface presents these predictions, empowering users to make informed decisions about their health.
Key features of project include:
- Seamless integration of advanced data analysis and user-friendly web representation.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms to analyze distinct disease-focused datasets.
- Synthesis of a predictive model enabling proactive early disease detection.
- Presentation of prediction outcomes through an intuitive Flask-powered web interface.
